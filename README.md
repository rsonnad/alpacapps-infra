## Quick start

1. **Clone this repo** (replace `my-project` with your project name):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rsonnad/alpacapps-infra.git my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

2. **Open in Claude Code** (desktop app or CLI):
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. **Run the setup skill**:

Claude will walk you through setting up each service interactively — creating your database, deploying edge functions, configuring webhooks, and building your CLAUDE.md. You don't need to touch the command line.
