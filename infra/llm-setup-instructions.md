# YOUR_APP_NAME Setup Instructions (Machine-Readable)

> **For Claude, ChatGPT, or any LLM helping a user set up YOUR_APP_NAME.**
> This file is the canonical setup reference. The HTML page at `/infra/` is the human-friendly overview.

## Overview

YOUR_APP_NAME is a full-stack platform using:
- **GitHub Pages** — static site hosting (free)
- **Supabase** — PostgreSQL database, auth, storage, edge functions (free tier)
- **Claude Code** — AI developer agent that writes and deploys code
- **Conductor** — Mac app for running parallel Claude Code agents (macOS only)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — styling framework

Architecture: Browser → GitHub Pages → Supabase (no server-side code). Edge functions handle sensitive operations.

## Setup Flow

### Phase 1: Claude Code guides initial setup
The user pastes a setup prompt into Claude Code. Claude Code should:

1. **Set up screenshots** — Detect the user's OS and help them set up one-click full-screen screenshot-to-clipboard:
   - **macOS**: Install [Shottr](https://shottr.cc) (free) or use ⌘+Ctrl+Shift+3
   - **Windows**: Win+Shift+S (Snip & Sketch) or PrtScn
   - **Linux**: Install [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org) or use desktop screenshot tool
   - Test by having user paste a screenshot into the conversation

2. **Install prerequisites** — Check and install as needed:
   - Git
   - GitHub CLI (`gh`)
   - Node.js (for Claude Code)

3. **Create GitHub repository** — From the template at `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO-infra`

4. **Enable GitHub Pages** — On the new repository, deploy from `main` branch

5. **Set up Supabase** — Create project, configure auth, run initial migrations

6. **Install Conductor** — Download and install the Mac app (macOS only)

### Phase 2: Switch to Conductor
Once Conductor is installed, the user switches from Claude Code in the terminal to Conductor for:
- Running the setup wizard (configures services based on user's needs)
- All future development (each task gets its own workspace with a dedicated AI agent)
- Code pushes to GitHub and the site updates automatically
